# Requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [wordup-cli](https://github.com/wordup-dev/wordup-cli)

# Optional

There is no need to use the awps-cli. But you can!

1. If you have awps in your system PATH, just run `npm run new:awps`
2. Then change your .env or wp-config.php files on the root of the project.
**NOTE:** Order is important!!! awps-cli replaces the original .env file of this repo so make sure to change it after you run awps-cli
3. Finnaly make sure to run `npm run update:wp` after.

# Usage

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gpedro34/wordup-awps.git YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE
```

2. Go into YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE/.wordup/ and change your configurations. [Refer to Wordup documentation](https://docs.wordup.dev/config)
3. Next you need to change your .env file inside YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE folder and verify wp-options.php
4. Then open package.json in the YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE folder and edit all instances of "YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE" and "your-project-name-here" by the name of your project (use dashes) and "YOUR_THEME_NAME_HERE" by your theme name (do not use dashes)
5. Once everything is configured properly, run `npm run new:git` and grab a coffee while the engines fire!  
**NOTE:** You may be prompt for sudo password at the end in order to access the docker volume and inject .env and wp-config.php into the running docker environment

The above command should have:

- Setup the docker containers (WP, wp-cli, mysql)
- Setup a new theme called YOUR_THEME_NAME_HERE inside YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE/src/themes/
- Remove the .env.sample, wp-options-sample.php and reinitialized git for the new theme
- Installed composer modules
- Installed npm modules
- Copy wp-config.php and .env to the root of your wordpress installation (sudo command)

# Considerations

## docker-compose

A docker-compose.yml at the root of your project extends the base wordup stack which already consists in:

- Wordpress container
- MySQL DB container
- wp-cli container

The base docker-compose file in this project is extending that stack with the PHPMyAdmin container although it's named d-c.yml so it doesn't get triggered automatically, so make sure to modify it's name to docker-compose.yml if you intend to run PHPMyAdmin automatically at wordup startup.

## PHPMyAdmin

If you need PHPMyAdmin at any point in time just run:

```bash
npm run d-c:up
```

Once you don't need it anymore you can save resources by running:

```bash
npm run d-c:down
```

## Webpack

AWPS uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix) for assets management. Check the official documentation for advanced options

- Edit the `webpack.mix.js` in the root directory of your theme to set your localhost URL and customize your assets
- `npm run watch` to start browserSync with LiveReload and proxy to your custom URL
- `npm run dev` to quickly compile and bundle all the assets without watching
- `npm run prod` to compile the assets for production

## Copying files to outside of wp-content

### Linux

As the wordpress container wordup launches already a volume called "your-project-name-here_wp_data" that we can inject the files to:

```bash
sudo cp .env /var/lib/docker/volumes/your-project-name-here_wp_data/_data/.env
sudo cp wp-config.php /var/lib/docker/volumes/your-project-name-here_wp_data/_data/wp-config.php
```

For convenience there is a npm script to handle this.

```bash
npm run up-config
```

### Windows and Mac

May have to fallback to something in the lines of the [4th or 5th answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22907231/copying-files-from-host-to-docker-container)
Or maybe use a bind mount to the running wordpress container and then execute a copy command to /var/www/html/.
