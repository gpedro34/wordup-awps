# Requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [wordup-cli](https://github.com/wordup-dev/wordup-cli)

# Usage

- Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gpedro34/wordup-awps.git YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

- Go into YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/.wordup and change your configurations. [Refer to Wordup documentation](https://docs.wordup.dev/config)
- Next you need to change your wp-options and .env files inside YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/wp-options folder
- Once you configured everything properly, open package.json in the YOUR_PROJECT_NAME folder and edit all instances of "YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE" by the name of your project with the words separated by dashes
- Once everything is configured properly, run:

```bash
npm run new-theme
```

The above command should:

- Setup the docker containers
- Setup a new theme called "awps" inside YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/src/themes/
- Removed the .env.sample, wp-options-sample.php and .git folder of the awps theme
- Installed composer modules
- Installed npm modules
- Copyed wp-config.php and .env to the root of your wordpress installation

NOTE: If you ever need to update your wp-config.php run:

```bash
npm run up-config
```

# Considerations

## Webpack

AWPS uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix) for assets management. Check the official documentation for advanced options

- Edit the `webpack.mix.js` in the root directory of your theme to set your localhost URL and customize your assets
- `npm run watch` to start browserSync with LiveReload and proxy to your custom URL
- `npm run dev` to quickly compile and bundle all the assets without watching
- `npm run prod` to compile the assets for production

## docker-compose

The docker-compose.yml at the root of your project extends the base wordup stack which already consists in:

- Wordpress container
- MySQL DB container
- wp-cli container

The base docker compose in this project is extending that stack with the PHPMyAdmin container

## Copying files to outside of wp-content

### Linux

As the wordpress container wordup launches already a volume called YOUR_PROJECT_NAME-wp_data we can use:

```bash
sudo cp ./wp-config/.env /var/lib/docker/volumes/test-installation_wp_data/_data/.env
sudo cp ./wp-config/wp-config.php /var/lib/docker/volumes/test-installation_wp_data/_data/wp-config.php
```

to access replace the files.

For convenience there is a npm script to handle this but ATM does not use environment variables so you will have to replace your project name manually inside the package.json file.

```bash
npm run up-config
```
